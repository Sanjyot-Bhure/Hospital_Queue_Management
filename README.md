# Clinic Appointment Data Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing clinic appointment data to improve operational efficiency by identifying key metrics such as patient wait times, no-show rates, and consultation durations. Using Python and Streamlit, an interactive dashboard was developed to visualize these metrics and provide actionable insights for optimizing appointment scheduling.

## Features
- Interactive dashboard displaying KPIs including:
  - Average patient wait time
  - No-show rates
  - Consultation durations
  - Appointment utilization
- Side-by-side bar chart comparing average wait time vs consultation time per doctor
- Identification of peak appointment hours and worst no-show days
- Data-driven recommendations to optimize appointment slots and reduce patient wait times

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Streamlit for building the interactive dashboard

## Future Work
-Implement predictive models to forecast no-shows
-Develop simulation models for appointment slot optimization
-Add filters and visualizations to the dashboard using Power BI
